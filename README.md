# text-cleaning-pipeline
A lightweight and efficient text preprocessing pipeline that cleans raw real-world text data and prepares it for NLP and machine learning applications.

## Features
- Converts text to lowercase
- Removes HTML tags
- Removes URLs
- Removes email addresses
- Normalizes extra spaces
- Removes punctuation and special characters
- Removes common stopwords
- Interactive user input

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Regular Expressions (re)

## How to Run
1. git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-cleaning-pipeline.git
2. cd text-cleaning-pipeline

*Run the program*

python main.py

## 💻 Sample Execution

> **User Input**

## 🎯 Project Significance

Real-world text data is often noisy, unstructured, and inconsistent.  
This project demonstrates how to design a robust preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw text into clean, structured input suitable for downstream machine learning tasks, including:

- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Text Classification**
- **Search & Information Retrieval**
- **Recommendation Systems**

By standardizing and enhancing raw textual data, this pipeline improves model performance, training stability, and overall system reliability in real world NLP applications.
